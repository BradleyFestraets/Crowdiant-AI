# Sprint Status Tracking - Crowdiant Restaurant OS
# Generated: 2025-11-26 16:45
# Project: Crowdiant AI
# Project Key: crowdiant-os
# Tracking System: file-system
# Story Location: docs/sprint-artifacts/

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Epic tech context created (*create-epic-tech-context)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created (*create-story)
#   - ready-for-dev: Story context created (*create-story-context)
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working (*dev-start)
#   - review: Implementation complete, in code review
#   - done: Story fully completed and deployed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been done (*epic-retrospective)

# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories drafted
# - SM drafts stories progressively (typically after previous story done)
# - Dev moves story: backlog → in-progress → review → done
# - All statuses start as 'backlog' until workflow commands run
